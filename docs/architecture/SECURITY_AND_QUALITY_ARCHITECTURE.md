# Security & Quality Control Architecture

This document clarifies the different security and quality control mechanisms in the system to avoid confusion between similarly named configuration files.

## Four Distinct Control Systems

### 1. LLM System Protection (`config/llm/system_protection.yaml`) 🛡️
**Purpose**: Comprehensive protection of the AI system from malicious inputs, attacks, and self-destructive behavior
**What it controls**:
- **Advanced Prompt Injection Prevention**: Multi-layer detection of delimiter attacks, instruction overrides, context manipulation, and jailbreak attempts
- **Self-Destructive Behavior Prevention**: Blocks attempts to modify agent configuration, system manipulation, and behavior modification
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive filtering of dangerous patterns including code execution, file system access, network requests, and database access attempts
- **Output Sanitization & Data Leakage Prevention**: Automatic redaction of credentials, PII, system information, and database connection strings
- **Security Monitoring & Logging**: Real-time detection, alerting, and response to security events
- **Error Handling**: Secure failure modes with user-friendly messages that don't reveal security details

**Enhanced Security Features**:
- 🔒 **Prompt Injection Patterns**: 40+ injection patterns across 4 attack categories
- 🚫 **Self-Destructive Prevention**: Protection against configuration modification and system manipulation
- 🔍 **Output Redaction**: Automatic removal of sensitive data from AI responses
- 📊 **Security Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting for security events
- ⚡ **Fail-Fast Security**: No fallback modes - secure failure by design

**Example**: "Is the user input safe for the AI system to process? Can the AI response leak sensitive data?"

### 2. LLM Output Validation (`config/llm/output_validation.yaml`) 🎯
**Purpose**: Comprehensive quality control and validation of AI agent responses and analysis outputs
**What it validates**:
- **Advanced Bias Detection**: Language preferences, confirmation bias, over-generalization patterns, and recency bias indicators
- **Hallucination Detection**: Regex-based validation of line references, method references, and technical claims with contradiction detection
- **Context Validation**: Required keywords, evidence indicators, uncertainty detection, and reasoning validation
- **Technical Jargon Control**: Excessive jargon detection with accessibility requirements
- **Confidence & Evidence Scoring**: Sophisticated scoring algorithms for response quality assessment
- **Response Improvement**: Quality enhancement instructions and bias prevention prompts

**Enhanced Quality Features**:
- 🧠 **Bias Prevention Prompts**: Cognitive, technical, and contextual bias prevention instructions
- 🔍 **Hallucination Detection**: Pattern-based detection of false claims and contradictions
- 📊 **Comprehensive Scoring**: Multi-factor confidence and evidence scoring algorithms
- 🎨 **Response Improvement**: Automated quality enhancement with clear improvement instructions
- 📈 **Quality Monitoring**: Detailed tracking of validation failures, bias indicators, and confidence scores
- ⚡ **No Fallbacks**: Strict fail-fast approach with no fallback strategies

**Example**: "Is the AI's code analysis accurate, unbiased, and properly evidenced?"

### 3. Application Security Analysis (`config/rules/security_analysis.yaml`) 🔐
**Purpose**: Defines security vulnerability detection rules for target applications
**What it analyzes**:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS prevention patterns
- Secrets detection in code
- Dependency security scanning
- Encryption standards compliance

**Example**: "Does the target code have security vulnerabilities?"

### 4. Code Quality Gates (`config/rules/quality_gates.yaml`) ✅
**Purpose**: Defines quality standards for the code being analyzed
**What it validates**:
- Code complexity thresholds
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Architecture quality metrics

**Example**: "Does the target code meet our quality standards?"
