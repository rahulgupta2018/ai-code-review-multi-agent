## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Google ADK Native Agents**
   - `LlmAgent` implementations for each analysis domain
   - `FunctionTool` patterns for reusable analysis capabilities
   - `BaseToolset` framework for tool discovery and management

2. **Tree-sitter Analysis Engine**
   - Multi-language AST parsing and analysis
   - Incremental parsing for performance optimization
   - Language-specific pattern recognition

3. **Dual LLM Strategy**
   - **Development**: Ollama (llama3.1:8b) for fast local iteration
   - **Production**: Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash-exp) for advanced reasoning

4. **Container-First Development**
   - Docker Compose profiles for different development scenarios
   - Custom ADK dev portal for monitoring and debugging
   - Redis for real-time coordination and caching
   - Production-ready API versioning strategy

### API Versioning Strategy

**Current Implementation:**
- **Versioned Endpoints**: `/api/v1/` prefix for all production endpoints
- **Legacy Support**: Backward compatibility maintained for existing integrations
- **Deprecation Management**: Clear migration path with deprecation warnings
- **Version Discovery**: API metadata available at `/api/v1/version`

**API Structure:**
```
# Production Endpoints (v1)
/api/v1/system/info       - System and ADK information
/api/v1/workspace/status  - Real-time workspace monitoring
/api/v1/tools            - Tool discovery and availability
/api/v1/logs             - Activity logs and diagnostics
/api/v1/version          - API version and capabilities

# Legacy Endpoints (deprecated but functional)
/api/system/info         - (deprecated) Use versioned endpoint
/api/workspace/status    - (deprecated) Use versioned endpoint  
/api/tools              - (deprecated) Use versioned endpoint
/api/logs               - (deprecated) Use versioned endpoint
```

### Quality Assurance Strategy

1. **API Design Standards**
   - RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes
   - Versioned endpoints with backward compatibility  
   - Comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Deprecation strategy for legacy endpoints

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for each tool and agent
   - Integration tests for multi-agent workflows
   - Performance benchmarks for large codebases
   - API endpoint testing with version compatibility

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - ADK-native configuration documentation
   - Tool usage guides and best practices
   - API documentation with examples
   - Migration guides for API version upgrades

4. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Real-time agent performance monitoring
   - Analysis result tracking and validation
   - Error reporting and recovery mechanisms
   - API usage analytics and deprecation tracking

## 🎯 Success Metrics
