# Agentic Code Review – Google GADK End-to-End Implementation Plan

> Adapted from `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` so every milestone runs on the Google Agent Development Kit (GADK) runtime, developer portal, and tooling stack.

---

## 1. Vision & Guiding Principles
- **Outcome**: Deliver the multi-agent code review platform on top of GADK while preserving the program’s memory-first architecture and quality guardrails.
- **Compatibility**: Maintain parity with the existing `CodeAnalyzerAgent` pipeline (complexity, architecture, anti-pattern detection, LLM insights, memory persistence).
- **Incremental Adoption**: Introduce GADK behind feature flags; the legacy executor remains available until parity and stability are validated.
- **Observability**: Use the Google GADK Developer Portal (“development port”) to visualize agent execution flows and debug sessions end-to-end.
- **LLM Flexibility**: Support native Ollama plus managed OpenAI and Gemini providers with configuration-driven routing and fallbacks.

## 2. Google GADK Primer for This Program

| GADK Construct | Usage in Agentic Code Review |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent Runtime** | Hosts domain agents (starting with `code_analyzer`), manages sessions, and registers tools/connectors. |
| **Agent** | Encapsulates analysis logic; reacts to orchestrator events (`on_session_started`, `on_event`, `on_complete`). |
| **Tool** | Deterministic callable that exposes heuristics, memory access, or integrations in an LLM-safe interface. |
| **Data Connector** | Bridges to SQLite memory, Redis state, configuration files, and LLM providers. |
| **Developer Portal (“Dev Port”)** | Web UI shipping with GADK that visualizes sessions, tool invocations, traces, and telemetry. |

### 2.1 Developer Tooling & Installation Checklist
1. **Enable Google GADK Preview** (if required) via Google Cloud console / Agent Builder program.
2. **Build the Shared Tooling Image** (no local Python installs):
   - Create a base image (e.g., `FROM python:3.11-slim`) that layers in the GADK CLI, dev-portal binaries, and project scripts.
   - During the image build run:
     ```bash
     pip install google-gadk
     gadk components install dev-portal
     ```
   - Publish the image to the internal registry for reuse across environments.
3. **Run the Developer Portal as a Containerized Service** to inspect live sessions:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -p 8200:8200 \
     -e GADK_PROJECT_ID=<gcp-project-id> \
     -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/secrets/gadk-sa.json \
     -v /path/to/secrets:/secrets:ro \
     <registry>/gadk-tooling:latest \
     gadk dev-portal start --project $GADK_PROJECT_ID --port 8200 --bind 0.0.0.0
   ```
   - Expose the service through the cluster ingress or port-forwarding when debugging.
   - Portal surfaces timelines, tool payloads, memory lookups, and LLM interactions.
4. **Configure LLM Connectivity (Ollama/OpenAI/Gemini)**:
  - Enable Vertex AI / Agent Builder APIs for GADK runtime access.
  - Verify the native Ollama service is reachable at `http://host.docker.internal:11434/` from the shared tooling container (no additional container needed); pre-pull required models on the host.
  - Register OpenAI and Gemini API access for production usage; capture API keys and optional custom base URLs for regional routing.
  - Create a service account for GADK runtime access; mount JSON credentials into the tooling container alongside `.env` secrets for the LLM providers.
5. **Inject Credentials & Flags**:
   - Store `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (or GADK equivalents) in Kubernetes secrets / container env.
    - Surface `analysis.use_gadk`, dev portal host/port, LLM provider defaults, Ollama endpoint, and GPU scheduling hints through configuration schemas or mounted `.env` files.

### 3.2 Enhanced Runtime Flow
1. **Input Processing**: Multi-source `InputProcessor` collects files from various sources (local, git, GitHub/GitLab API, ZIP) with language detection and AST parsing.
2. **Configuration Loading**: `ConfigManager` loads environment-driven configuration with agent-specific settings and quality control rules.
3. **Memory Initialization**: Memory systems (SQLite persistent + Redis transient) are initialized with retrieval coordinator and pattern recognition engine.
4. **Orchestrator Intelligence**: Enhanced orchestrator selects agents using LLM reasoning with historical performance data and memory context.
5. **GADK Session Creation**: Orchestrator opens GADK session through `AgentRuntime` with memory integration and real-time state coordination.
6. **Memory-Enhanced Analysis**: Session receives `AnalyzeCodeEvent` with memory context, historical patterns, and learned thresholds.
7. **Intelligent Tool Orchestration**: Memory-aware GA agent orchestrates registered tools (complexity → pattern → architecture → LLM insights → QC) with context-aware memory retrieval and pattern learning.
8. **Real-time Coordination**: Redis coordination layer manages multi-agent dependencies, progress tracking, and WebSocket broadcasting.
9. **Learning Integration**: Agent learns from analysis results, updates patterns, adjusts confidence scores, and stores experiences for future use.
10. **Enhanced Results**: Agent emits `AnalysisComplete` with findings enhanced by historical context, supporting patterns, and confidence calibration.
11. **Memory Persistence**: Analysis experiences and learned patterns are persisted to SQLite for cross-project learning and continuous improvement.
12. **Result Integration**: Orchestrator converts GADK payload into `AgentResult` objects with memory context, persists learning, and continues downstream workflows.

### 3.3 Enhanced Memory & State Architecture
- **SQLite Persistent Memory**: Advanced memory store with multi-dimensional indexing (agent, type, keyword, context, temporal) and pattern recognition capabilities.
- **Redis Real-time Coordination**: Session lifecycle management, multi-agent dependency resolution, real-time progress tracking with WebSocket broadcasting, and intelligent caching with TTL/tag-based invalidation.
- **Memory Retrieval Coordinator**: Unified interface supporting multiple retrieval strategies (contextual, similarity, pattern, content, partition) with performance tracking and optimization.
- **Memory Partitioning System**: Multi-dimensional organization (PROJECT, LANGUAGE, PATTERN, AGENT, TEMPORAL, COMPLEXITY, DOMAIN) with automatic management and cross-partition linking.
- **Context-Aware Access Patterns**: Intelligent retrieval strategies (RECENT, SIMILAR, CROSS_CONTEXT, TEMPORAL, CONFIDENCE_BASED) with analysis phase optimization and effectiveness tracking.
- **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Learns and recognizes code patterns, architectural patterns, anti-patterns, security patterns, and performance patterns with confidence scoring.
- **Learning & Feedback System**: Continuous improvement through pattern learning, confidence calibration, feedback integration, and cross-project knowledge accumulation.
- **SessionState Enhanced**: Comprehensive state management with memory context, learning integration, and real-time coordination capabilities.

### 3.4 Deployment Baseline & LLM Connectivity
- **Runtime Pod**: Hosts GADK runtime, GA agents, and tool adapters. Built from the shared tooling image with GPU drivers available through Kubernetes `nvidia.com/gpu` resources (when scheduled on GPU nodes).
- **Native Ollama Host**: Ollama continues to run on the host with GPU support and exposes `http://host.docker.internal:11434/`. Runtime containers use that URL for inference, so ensure host networking (or Kubernetes node host mapping) is permitted and TLS-forwarding is configured if required.
- **External LLM APIs**: OpenAI and Gemini integrations run over HTTPS against their managed endpoints, with credentials supplied via environment variables and optional proxy/base-URL overrides.
- **Dev Portal Pod**: Deploys the GADK developer portal container for observability; reachable via port-forward or ingress.
- **Networking**: Allow egress from the runtime pod to both `host.docker.internal` (for native Ollama) and the public OpenAI/Gemini API domains; lock down firewall rules accordingly.
- **Secrets & Config**: Managed through Kubernetes secrets/ConfigMaps and mounted `.env` files; no filesystem mutations needed at runtime.

## 6. Enhanced Data & Control Flow (GADK Path with Memory Integration)
1. **Enhanced Input Processing**: Multi-source `InputProcessor` collects files from local directories, git repositories, GitHub/GitLab APIs, ZIP archives, and single files with language detection and Tree-sitter AST parsing.
2. **Configuration & Memory Initialization**: `ConfigManager` loads environment-driven configuration while memory systems (SQLite + Redis) initialize with retrieval coordinator and pattern recognition engine.
3. **Intelligent Session Creation**: Orchestrator opens GADK session via `runtime_factory.get_runtime()` with memory context and historical performance data.
4. **Memory-Enhanced Event Dispatch**: `AnalyzeCodeEvent` (serialized `CodeContext`, configs, thresholds, memory context, learned patterns) is sent to the memory-aware GA agent.
5. **Context-Aware Tool Orchestration**: GA agent calls registered tools with memory integration, each accessing relevant historical patterns and logging to dev portal with memory trace information.
6. **Advanced Quality & Memory Processing**: `QualityControlTool` filters findings with bias prevention and evidence validation; `MemoryRetrievalTool` provides intelligent context; `PatternRecognitionTool` learns new patterns; `ConfidenceScoringTool` calibrates confidence based on historical accuracy.
7. **Real-time Coordination**: Redis coordination layer manages session state, agent dependencies, progress tracking, and WebSocket broadcasting for live updates.
8. **Learning Integration**: Analysis experiences are learned, patterns updated, confidence scores calibrated, and cross-project knowledge accumulated.
9. **Enhanced Results Generation**: Agent emits `AnalysisComplete` with memory-enhanced findings, supporting patterns, confidence scores, and learning updates.
10. **Structured Output Generation**: `OutputGenerationTool` formats findings into multiple formats (JSON, HTML, PDF); `DashboardExportTool` creates dashboard-ready metrics; `ReportTemplateTool` generates customized reports; agent-specific outputs are stored in `outputs/{agent_name}/` directories.
11. **Cross-Agent Consolidation**: `ConsolidatedOutputTool` combines results from all agents into executive summaries, technical reports, and comprehensive dashboard data stored in `outputs/consolidated/`.
12. **Memory Persistence & API Delivery**: Analysis experiences and learned patterns are persisted to SQLite for cross-project learning; orchestrator serves results via REST APIs and WebSocket updates; formatted reports are available for download and dashboard consumption.

- **Comprehensive Integration Tests**: Run pytest suite with `USE_GADK=true` including memory validation; compare outputs vs. legacy executor across multiple analysis scenarios; capture portal traces and memory access patterns for evidence and debugging.
- **Multi-Provider & Learning Tests**: Exercise `LLMInsightTool` against native Ollama, OpenAI (mocked), and Gemini (mocked) endpoints; verify fallback ordering, error handling, and provider performance learning when providers are unavailable or underperforming.
- **Real-time Coordination Tests**: Validate Redis coordination layer, session management, multi-agent dependencies, progress tracking, and WebSocket broadcasting under various load conditions and failure scenarios.
- **Quality Control Integration Tests**: Test bias prevention, hallucination detection, evidence validation, and finding calibration across different code types and languages with comprehensive rule validation.

- **Advanced Resilience Tests**: Inject comprehensive failures (LLM errors, database timeouts, Redis failures, memory corruption, network partitions) to ensure agent reports issues cleanly within GADK session boundaries with proper recovery and state reconstruction.
- **End-to-End Workflow Tests**: Validate complete workflows from input processing through memory-enhanced analysis to result delivery with real-world repository examples and production-like scenarios.
- **Learning & Feedback Loop Tests**: Validate pattern learning accuracy, confidence calibration effectiveness, cross-project knowledge transfer, and feedback integration with longitudinal testing across multiple analysis cycles.
