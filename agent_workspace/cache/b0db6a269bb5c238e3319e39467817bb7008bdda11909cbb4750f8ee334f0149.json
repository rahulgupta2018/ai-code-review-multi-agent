    "report": "# Code Review Report\n\n## Executive Summary  \nThe code review for `run_agent_sequential` function identified **5 issues** across security, engineering practices, and environmental impact. The top concerns are related to modularity (modularity), error handling clarity (error_handling), and adherence to best practices (missing_type_annotations). No critical vulnerabilities were found but several medium severity areas require immediate attention.\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Detailed Findings\n\n### Security Analysis  \n**Summary:** No direct security vulnerabilities detected, but the code exposes sensitive information in verbose logs. The presence of **A6: Security Misconfiguration** from OWASP Top 10 highlights potential risks if debug modes are enabled in production environments.\n\n- **Vulnerabilities:** []  \n- **OWASP Top 10 Risks:** A6 (Medium) - Verbose error messages exposed, sensitive data handling.  \n\n### Engineering Practices Analysis  \nThe function violates several design principles and best practices:\n\n1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The function handles multiple responsibilities such as runner creation, session management, event processing, and retry/error handling.\n2. **Separation of Concerns:** All functionality is tightly coupled within a single function, making it harder to maintain and test.\n3. **Type Annotations Compliance:** Parameters lack explicit type annotations (non-compliant).\n4. **Retry Logic Centralization:** Exponential backoff logic is duplicated in both success and failure branches.\n\n### Specific Engineering Recommendations  \n- Add type annotations to all parameters.  \n- Extract runner creation into a separate function.  \n- Create a centralized retry utility for exponential backoff handling.  \n\n## Carbon Emission Considerations\n\nThe code review identified several opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint:\n\n1. **Excessive Logging:** Minimize logging in both success and failure branches; centralize error-only logs.\n2. **Resource Usage Optimization:**\n   - Reuse `Runner` instances across retries to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.\n   - Cache session objects or reuse existing connections during retry loops.\n3. **Energy Consumption Evaluation:**  \n   - Exponential backoff delays are minimal but can be optimized using non-blocking strategies.\n\n## Specific Optimization Suggestions  \n\n- Implement a single shared `Runner` instance for all attempts.  \n- Use connection pooling to reduce database roundtrips and network latency.  \n\nBy addressing these issues, the code will not only enhance security and maintainability but also improve its environmental impact by reducing unnecessary resource consumption.",
