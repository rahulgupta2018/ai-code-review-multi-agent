    "report": "# Code Review Report\n\n## Executive Summary  \n- **Total Issues Found:** 5  \n- **Severity Breakdown:** Critical (0), High (1: Security Misconfiguration), Medium (2: Excessive Nested Loops, Session Creation Overhead), Low (1: No Sensitive Data Exposure)  \n- **Key Concerns:**  \n  - Potential for verbose error messages exposing system details.  \n  - High cyclomatic complexity and nesting depth impacting maintainability.  \n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Detailed Findings\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 Security Analysis\n**Summary:** Security analysis completed with no critical findings. Code follows best practices for secure execution.\n\n- **Security Misconfiguration (Medium Risk):**  \n  - **Instances:** 1  \n  - **Recommendation:** Disable debug modes and avoid exposing stack traces in production environments.\n- **Sensitive Data Exposure (Low Risk):**  \n  - No instances of sensitive data exposure.  \n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Engineering Practices Analysis\n**Summary:** Code demonstrates good structure but has room for improvement in maintainability, error handling granularity, and security.\n\n#### Design Principles Assessment\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (Violated):** The `run_agent_sequential` function handles multiple concerns violating SRP.\n  - **Recommendation:** Extract responsibilities into separate methods or classes (e.g., SessionManager, RunnerInitializer).\n- **Open/Closed Principle (Partially Violated):** Changes may require modifications in multiple places if new session types or error handling strategies are added.\n  - **Recommendation:** Use interfaces/abstract classes for components that can be extended without modifying existing code.\n\n#### Code Organization Evaluation\n- **Mixed Concerns:** The same file contains business logic and infrastructure code related to session management, violating separation of concerns.  \n  - **Recommendation:** Move session creation, runner setup, and error handling into dedicated modules or classes.\n- **Lack of Modularization:** All agent type logic is implemented in one function, hindering scalability.\n\n#### Documentation Quality Analysis\n- **Function Docstring (Missing):** Comprehensive docstrings covering parameters, return values, exceptions are missing.  \n  - **Recommendation:** Add detailed docstrings explaining each parameter and possible outcomes.\n- **Error Handling Documentation (Issue):** Verbose error messages may leak internal implementation details.  \n  - **Recommendation:** Centralize logging of errors without exposing sensitive information.\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 Carbon Emission Analysis\n**Summary:** Code analysis reveals moderate energy consumption due to multiple retries, session creation overhead, and potential inefficiencies in async event handling.\n\n- **Excessive Retry Logic (Medium Energy Impact):** Retries up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff can lead to unnecessary CPU cycles.  \n  - **Recommendation:** Limit retries or implement a more intelligent retry policy.\n- **Session Creation Overhead (Low Energy Impact):** Creating new session objects in each attempt leads to memory allocation overhead.  \n  - **Recommendation:** Reuse existing sessions where possible.\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 Recommendations\n\n1. **Security Improvements:**\n   - Disable debug modes and avoid exposing stack traces.\n2. **Engineering Best Practices:**\n   - Extract responsibilities into separate methods/classes following SRP principles.\n   - Implement intelligent retry logic with jitter or circuit breakers to reduce energy waste from repeated failed operations.\n3. **Documentation Enhancements:**\n   - Add comprehensive docstrings for functions, covering parameters and return values.\n4. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - Centralize logging of errors without exposing sensitive information.\n   - Reuse session objects where possible to minimize memory churn.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Energy Consumption Evaluation\n\n- **Retry Mechanism:** Medium energy impact due to exponential backoff delays and repeated session creation.\n  - **Recommendation:** Implement smarter retry logic or reduce the number of retries.\n- **Asynchronous Event Loop:** Low energy consumption, but context switching can lead to minor increases in power usage.  \n  - **Recommendation:** Optimize event loop size and ensure efficient I/O operations.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Steps\n\n1. Refactor codebase following engineering best practices outlined above.\n2. Implement security improvements as recommended.\n3. Conduct performance profiling to identify further optimization opportunities, especially around retry logic and asynchronous handling.\n\nThis comprehensive review aims to enhance the maintainability, security, and energy efficiency of the code while aligning with industry standards for software development.",
